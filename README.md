# WELCOME TO PI DAY
Today you will get experience building a _home automation_ environment by leveraging Raspberry Pi devices with SenseHats using C# on the .NET Core 3.1 runtime! You will collect data from a variety of sensors and send them up to Azure for further processing.

For those _less interested_ in hacking on the Raspberry Pi's, there will be demos of Microsoft Azure's IoT Edge platform for managing a fleet of devices in your own organization.

## What you need
Ideally, you will bring a laptop on which you have admin permissions to install the software you need and to connect to any wireless network.  If you have that now, head over to [LAB 0](labs) and get that setup now.

An Azure environment will be provided for you to use for later in the day.
